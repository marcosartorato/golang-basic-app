# Local Environment

This folder contains everything you need to run a local k3s (via k3d) cluster,
a local image registry, deploy the app, and test it from inside the cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- k3d (`brew install k3d` or see https://k3d.io)

## Commands

The following commands can be run from the repository root directory.
This setup uses the ctrl cluster (as defined in `./k3d/cluster.yaml`).

```sh
# Create the cluster (with registry)
k3d cluster create --config ./k3d/cluster.yaml

# Start Tilt to build, deploy, and watch the controller.
# Tilt automatically rebuilds and redeploys on source code changes.
tilt up

# Delete resources created by "tilt up".
tilt down

# Delete the cluster.
k3d cluster delete myapp
```

The cluster is up! The cluster can be explored using `k9s` or `kubectl`.

To clean the local environment:

- Press `Ctrl`+`C` to stop tilt.
- Run `k3d cluster stop ctrl` to stop the cluster.
- Run `k3d cluster delete ctrl` to delete the cluster.

## Metrics and Logs

The local cluster uses Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana as the metrics/logs stack. They are deployed via Helm and Tilt. 

The Grafana user interface is exposed and can be accessed [here](http://localhost:3000/). Use Grafana to explore information related to logs and metrics. Grafanaâ€™s dashboard is usually sufficient for exploring logs and metrics. If you need direct access to Prometheus or Loki, you can port-forward their Kubernetes services to a local port.

To get Grafana username and password, run:

```
k get secret/grafana-ui -n monitoring -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-user}' | base64 -d
k get secret/grafana-ui -n monitoring -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d
```

Loki and Prometheus are already configured as Grafana datasources by the related [value](monitoring/grafana/values.yaml) file. To setup additional data sources, goes on the [related section](http://localhost:3000/connections/datasources) in the Grafana user interface.
